# ASD-TWAS

## Introduction

Our project gives...

### Prerequisites

The following R packages are required:

reshape2

survival

data.table

optparse

methods

survival

tidyverse

dplyr

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Input Data

| Parameter                   | Directory Name | Description                                                                  |
|----------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tissue            | --tissue      | The Tissue |
| Chromosone         | --chr          | The chromosome of the gene        |
| Gene | --gene        |                | The gene name
| Family path           |--famPath | The path of the fam file, the ids in the fam file should fit the ids from the vcf file  |
| Prediction          |--pred | The path of the original prediciton matrix  |
| VCF           |--vcf | The path of the vcf file, retrieved by step 0|

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Step 1

Download  prediction model(in txt) and TWAS

```
wget public/path/to/be/open
wget /twas/path/to be use
```

### Step 2
Run association test


Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Step 3

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
